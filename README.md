# webcam-server-dotnet

A fork of [webcam-server-dotnet](https://code.google.com/p/webcam-server-dotnet/). The goal of original project was to create an application which is running on Win7 and can do the same think as mjpg_streamer. MJPEG streamer is a linux tool for get pictures in jpeg format from webcameras using less CPU resource.

I am going to fix some bugs in original version.
